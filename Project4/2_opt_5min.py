#As two_opt loops through the circuit, breakig two conections at a time and improving them, and each call of two_opt makes a loop of all nodes, each call will most likely be an incremental improvement.  Therefore, if we have a time period of 5min, it would be best to make as many calls of two-opt as possible in that time period that still improve the overall circuit.  Essentially LP.
